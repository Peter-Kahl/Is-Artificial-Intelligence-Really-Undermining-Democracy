### Abstract

Mark Coeckelbergh’s recent book, Why AI Undermines Democracy (2024), argues compellingly that artificial intelligence (AI) intrinsically threatens democratic governance through epistemic manipulation, deepening knowledge asymmetries, and fostering political alienation. While acknowledging Coeckelbergh’s valuable insights into the democratic vulnerabilities exacerbated by digital technologies, this essay critiques his foundational assumption that AI inherently possesses political or epistemic agency. Drawing upon fiduciary epistemic theory—particularly as elaborated in my works Epistemic Justice and Institutional Responsibility in Academia and Directors’ Epistemic Duties and Fiduciary Openness—I propose an alternative framework that explicitly situates responsibility and moral accountability within human governance structures and institutional actors. The essay argues that attributing political and epistemic agency to AI risks obscuring institutional accountability, diminishing fiduciary clarity, and ultimately weakening democratic safeguards. Instead, by recognising AI as epistemically neutral and emphasising explicit fiduciary duties, clearer, more robust pathways emerge for institutional reform, democratic accountability, epistemic pluralism, and sustainable governance of AI technologies.
